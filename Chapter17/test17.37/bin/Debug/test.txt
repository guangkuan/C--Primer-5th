char ch; // using a char here invites disaster!
// the return from cin.get is converted to char and then compared to an int
while ((ch = cin.get()) != EOF)
cout.put(ch);

The problem is that when get returns EOF, that value will be converted to
an unsigned char value. That converted value is no longer equal to the
int value of EOF, and the loop will continue forever. Such errors are likely to be
caught in testing.
