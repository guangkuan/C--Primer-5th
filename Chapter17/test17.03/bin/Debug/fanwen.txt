Primitive forms of data networks have a long history, including the smoke signals used
by primitive societies, and certainly including nineteenth-century telegraphy. The messages
in these systems were first manually encoded into strings of essentially binary
symbols, and then manually transmitted and received. Where necessary, the messages
were manually relayed at intermediate points.
A major development, in the early 1950s, was the use of communication links
to connect central computers to remote terminals and other peripheral devices, such as
printers and remote job entry points (RIEs) (see Fig. 1.1). The number of such peripheral
devices expanded rapidly in the 1960s with the development of time-shared computer
systems and with the increasing power of central computers. With the proliferation of
remote peripheral devices, it became uneconomical to provide a separate long-distance
communication link to each peripheral. Remote multiplexers or concentrators were developed
to collect all the traffic from a set of peripherals in the same area and to send
it on a single link to the central processor. Finally, to free the central processor from
handling all this communication, special processors called front ends were developed to
control the communication to and from all the peripherals. This led to the more complex
structure shown in Fig. 1.2. The communication is automated in such systems, in
contrast to telegraphy, for example, but the control of the communication is centrally
exercised at the computer. While it is perfectly appropriate and widely accepted to refer
to such a system as a data network or computer communication network, it is simpler
to view it as a computer with remote peripherals. Many of the interesting problems
associated with data networks, such as the distributed control of the system, the relaying
of messages over multiple communication links, and the sharing of communication links
between many users and processes, do not arise in these centralized systems.
